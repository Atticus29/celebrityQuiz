# Project Starter for Epicodus
This project starter includes a skeleton index.html, empty javascript file located in "js/scripts.js", empty css file located in "css/styles.css" and an empty img directory. The skeleton html includes 2 CDN links for bootstrap and jQuery.
It also includes a bash script that will initialize git pairs, add commits, and push to the remote repo when two user's initial and link to the repo have been provided.

## Using the project starter
```
cd /desiredLocation

```
git clone https://github.com/doomcatlee/build

```
## Using bash script (gitSet)

cd /build
```
```
chmod 755 gitSet
```
```
